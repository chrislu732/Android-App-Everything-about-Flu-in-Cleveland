<h1>Learn About Influenza</h1>

<h2>What Is Influenza?</h2>
<p>The flu is a respiratory infection caused by flu viruses. The viruses pass through the air and enter your body through your nose or mouth. It can also be acquired from contaminated surfaces. Between 5 percent and 20 percent of people in the United States get the flu each year. It can cause mild to severe illness, and in some cases, may lead to hospitalization or death. Symptoms of the flu are similar to those of the common cold, but they last longer and tend to be worse.</p>

<h2>How Serious Is Influenza?</h2>
<p>This decrease in quality of life, the impact of symptoms, the shifting nature of the virus, and the danger of life-threatening complications, combine to make the flu a major public health problem. The American Lung Association summarizes the impact of influenza on Americans in our Trends in Pneumonia and Influenza Morbidity and Mortality report. </p>
<p>Each year between 3,000 and 49,000 Americans die from flu and its complications. Although most people are back on their feet within a week after having the flu, certain people are more susceptible to complications. If you have asthma or other lung diseases, or other chronic conditions you are at higher risk of developing complications from the flu.</p>

<h2>How Influenza Affects Your Body?</h2>
<p>The flu affects your whole body—including your nose, throat and lungs—and can lead to serious complications in those with chronic illness.</p>
<p>“Many people who become sick with the flu say it is like being hit by a truck. Flu symptoms, such as high fever, cough and muscle aches, usually come on suddenly and are more severe than colds. Not only does having the flu impact your daily activities, it also leads to missed days from work and school.</p>
<p>Complications can include pneumonia, ear or sinus infections, dehydration, and worsening of chronic medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure, asthma or diabetes.</p>
<p>The flu can be fatal in elderly people, people with chronic diseases; and anyone with a weak immune system.</p>

<h2>How Is Influenza Diagnosed?</h2>
<p>It is hard to know for sure you have the flu on based on symptoms alone. A doctor's exam may be needed to tell whether you have developed the flu or a complication of the flu. If you develop flu-like symptoms and are concerned about your illness because you are at high risk for complications or any other reason, you should talk to your healthcare provider. There are tests that can determine if you have the flu as long you are tested within the first two or three days of illness and many providers use antiviral medications when they are confident of the diagnosis.</p>

<h2>What Are The Treatments For The flu?</h2>
<p>Most people with the flu recover on their own without medical care. People with mild cases of the flu should stay home and avoid contact with others, except to get medical care.</p>
<p>But if you have symptoms of flu and are in a high risk group or are very sick or worried about your illness, contact your health care provider. You might need antiviral medicines to treat your flu. Antiviral medicines can make the illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious flu complications. They usually work best when you start taking them within 2 days of getting sick.</p>

<h1>Prevention</h1>
<h2>Get a Flu Vaccine Every Year</h2>
<p>The best way to prevent influenza is to get a flu vaccine every year. The influenza virus is constantly changing. Each year, scientists work together to identify the virus strains that they believe will cause the most illness, and a new vaccine is made based on their recommendations.</p>

<h2>Wash Your Hands</h2>
<p>Thorough and frequent hand-washing is an effective way to prevent many common infections. Or use alcohol-based hand sanitizers if soap and water aren't readily available.</p>

<h2>Contain Your Coughs and Sneezes</h2>
<p>Cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough. To avoid contaminating your hands, cough or sneeze into a tissue or into the inner crook of your elbow.</p>

<h2>Avoid Crowds</h2>
<p>The flu spreads easily wherever people congregate — in child care centers, schools, office buildings, auditoriums and public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you reduce your chances of infection. And if you're sick, stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever subsides so that you lessen your chance of infecting others.</p>

<h2>Practice Good Health Habits</h2>
<p>Get plenty of sleep, exercise regularly, drink plenty of fluids, eat a nutritious diet and manage your stress.</p>
